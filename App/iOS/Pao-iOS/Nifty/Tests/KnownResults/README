This directory contains known test results. Each file contains results for a particular test case and is named for that test case. 

Contained in this directory are subdirectories that hold the code that was used to generate the known results, each named for the language and/or library that was used to generate the results. Within each subdirectory are the scripts/functions to generate the results, named identically as the results file it generates. Additionally, each subdirectory should contain a "main" file that can be run to kick off all scripts in the subdirectory and regenerate all known results files.

For example, inside an XCTest class, a particular member function may test the Nifty function `foo`. Such a function may be named `testSomeDescription_foo3`, where the stem of the function begins with "test" (following Xcode convention) and provides a useful description of what's being tested, and the suffix indicates that it is the third test case for `foo`. The corresponding known results file(s) (if there are any; not all tests may have them) would be located in this folder, named in the format `results_<language>_<tag>_<test case>`, e.g. "results_python_foo3.csv", "results_matlab_3_foo3.txt", etc. The source language, optional tag, and file extension may change, but the name must begin with "results" and end with the corresponding test case function name.
